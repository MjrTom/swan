# This GitHub Action bumps up the <Version /> tag in the csproj file depending on the commit's comment:
#   SemVer format is: MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH-PRERELEASE
#   If the commit's comment contains the string [MAJOR], [MINOR] or [PATCH] it bumps it accordingly.
#   If no matching bump commment is found, the PRERELEASE component gets bumped.
# Finally, it builds the project in .net 5 and .net 6, and publishes it to the local GitHub package registry.
